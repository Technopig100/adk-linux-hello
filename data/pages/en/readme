ADK-Linux not only supports the use of multiple kernels (selectable from the advanced options at the boot screen), but also provides access to the very latest bleeding-edge kernels as well.

<big>Getting help</big>

Although ADK-Linux is designed to work as much "out of the box" as possible, we don't claim it's perfect. There can be times when things go wrong, you might have questions and a desire to learn more, or just want to personalize it to suit your tastes. This page provides details of some available resources to help you!

<b>Search the web</b>

Perhaps the first place to look for generic Linux help is by using your favorite search engine. Just include words like 'Linux', 'ADK-Linux' or 'Arch' in your search query.

<b>Look in the forums</b>

For specific help with ADK-Linux we have a dedicated online forum where you can search for topics, or create one yourself! This is probably the next best place to go for collaboration, discussion and assistance. Ask for help, post your thoughts, or outline some suggestions. Don't be shy!

The ADK-Linux forum is divided into sub-forums for different topics and environments, please post your query in the appropriate place!

<b>Join us on Telegram</b>
